# Migrating from TypeORM to Prisma

This repo contains a sample Express server with two main branches:

- [`main`](https://github.com/prisma/migrate-from-typeorm-to-prisma): Initial version of the Express server built with TypeORM
- [`prisma`](https://github.com/prisma/migrate-from-typeorm-to-prisma/tree/prisma): Final version of the Express server after it was migrated to Prisma 

The [guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/migrate-to-prisma/migrate-from-typeorm) that walks through the migration process can be found in the [Prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs).
